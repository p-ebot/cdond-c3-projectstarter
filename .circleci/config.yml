### It's a good practice to keep your commands at the top of the config file. In this project, you'll need at least 2 commands:

# commands:
#   destroy-environment:
#     description: Destroy backend and frontend cloudformation stacks given a workflow ID.
#     ...

#   revert-migration:
#     description: Revert the last migration if successfully run in the current workflow.
#     ...

#jobs:
  #hello-world: # Delete this job when you get started
    #docker:
    #  - image: amazon/aws-cli
    #steps:
    #  - checkout
    #  - run:
    #      name: Say Hello
    #      command: |
    #        echo "Hello World"
